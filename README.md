Some personal scripts that I need to share conveniently, but that are not
necessarily intended or suitable for general use.

`firefox-temporary-profile.sh`
------------------------------
Start Firefox with a temporary profile (confined to
[firejail](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail)).

`i3_bar.sh`
-----------
A small bash script to populate [i3bar](https://github.com/i3/i3) with useful
data.

`music_dmenu.pl`
----------------
Perl script for mpv / other media players. Lists the content of a media
collection using dmenu and plays the selected files / albums.

`top.awk`
---------
Analyze the output of top -b -c (ran for some time and redirected to a file).
(Uses `gawk`.)
