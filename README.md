Some personal scripts that I need to share conveniently, but that are not
necessarily intended or suitable for general use.

`firefox-temporary-profile`
-------------------------
Start Firefox with a temporary profile (confined to
[firejail](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail)).

`i3_bar.sh`
---------
A small bash script to populate [i3bar](https://github.com/i3/i3) with useful
data.
